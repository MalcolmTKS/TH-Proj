#  üõ°Ô∏èThreat Hunting & Malware Research üõ°Ô∏è

I configured an isolated virtual environment to conduct Threat Hunting tasks and to implement the TH workflow. This entails hunting for adversary TTPs, post-exploitation attacks against various endpoints, cloud systems, and analyzing raw netflow/log sources commonly seen in an enterprise environment.

### **Desired Outcome**
- Acquire practical hands-on experience through continuous practice.


### **My Objectives**

- Taking a proactive approach to hunt for suspicious activity against network/host(Windows/Linux/Cloud )end systems. 
- Create/execute playbooks, utilizing Atomic Red Team or Attack Payloads from Pentest Reports or Open-source security datasets. 


# What is Threat Hunting?
Threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network. Cyber threat hunting digs deep to find malicious actors in your environment that have slipped past your initial endpoint security defenses.

After sneaking in, an attacker can stealthily remain in a network for months as they quietly collect data, look for confidential material, or obtain login credentials that will allow them to move laterally across the environment. That‚Äôs why threat hunting is an essential component of any defense strategy.


# Threat Hunting Artifacts

Malware- Malicious software that hasn‚Äôt been detected by traditional signature-based anti-virus solutions.

Web Shells - Typically .php scripts that allow an attacker to take control of a web server and access everything as if they are on the server directly.

Unusual Network Activity - Such as traffic originating or going to unusual ports, larger-than-expected packets, and unusual DNS queries.

Modified System Objects - Such as registry entries on Windows OS that have been altered or impersonated.

Unauthorized remote application tools or LOL Bins  leveraged with malicious intent.
